1.  Summary Abstract

SWITCHBOARD is a corpus of spontaneous conversations which addresses
the growing need for large multispeaker databases of telephone
bandwidth speech.  Collected at Texas Instruments with funding by
DARPA, the complete set of CD-ROMs includes about 2430 conversations
averaging 6 minutes in length; in other terms, over 240 hours of
recorded speech, and about 3 million words of text, spoken by over 500
speakers of both sexes from every major dialect of American English.

Apart from sheer volume, however, it has a number of unique features
designed to support telephone-based speech technology development as
well as basic research on spontaneous conversational speech and
language.

First, SWITCHBOARD was collected without human intervention, under
computer control.  Interaction with the system was via touchtones and
recorded instructions, but the two talkers, once connected, could
"warm up" before recording began.  From a human factors perspective,
automation guards against the intrusion of experimenter bias, and
guarantees a degree of uniformity throughout the long period of data
collection.  The protocols were further intended to elicit natural and
spontaneous speech by the participants.  The transcribers' ratings
indicate that they perceived the conversations as highly natural.

Second, the use of T1 lines and automatic switching software made it
possible to collect the digital version of the speech signals directly
from the telephone network, and also to isolate the two sides of the
conversations.  The goal was to have real telephone speech, routed
through the public network, but with no degradation due to the
collection system.  Isolation of the callers, within the limits of
network echo cancelling performance, permits researchers to train on
each speaker's voice separately, and then test on either one or both
speakers in any conversation.

Third, the speech is fully transcribed, and the transcription
conventions documented.  Court reporters produced most of the verbatim
transcripts, following a manual prepared specifically for the project.
Their work was checked for formatting errors by an awk script, then
twice more by humans during quality control (QC) inspections.

Fourth, each transcript is accompanied by a time alignment file, which
estimates the beginning time and duration of each word in the
transcript in centiseconds.  The time alignment was accomplished with
supervised phone-based speech recognition, as described by Wheatley et
al. [1].  The corpus is therefore capable of supporting not only
purely text-independent approaches to speaker verification, but also
those which make use of any degree of knowledge of the text, including
phonetics.  It should also facilitate studies of the phonetic
characteristics of spontaneous speech on a scale not previously
possible.

Fifth, SWITCHBOARD has both depth and breadth of coverage for studying
speaker characteristics.  Forty eight people participated 20 times or
more; this adds up to about, an hour of speech, enough for extensive
training or modeling and for repeated testing with unseen material.
Hundreds of others participated ten times or less, providing a pool
large enough for many open-set experiments.

Sixth, the participants' demographics, as well as the dates, times,
and other pertinent information about each phone call, are recorded in
relational database tables.  Except for personal information about the
callers, these tables are included with the corpus.  The volunteers
who participated provided information relevant to studies of voice,
dialect, and other aspects of speech style, including age, sex,
education, current residence, and places of residence during formative
years.  The exact time and the area code of origin of each call is
provided, as well as a means of telling which calls by the same person
came from different telephones.  Many callers made calls from multiple
handsets, in order to facilitate study of the effects of that variable
on voice recognition.



2.  Overview of Directory and File Structure

There are 25 speech discs in the Switchboard Corpus (NIST Speech Discs
9-3.1 - 9-27.1).  Each disc has a "readme.doc" file and a "swb1"
subdirectory in the top-level directory.  The "readme.doc" file
contains information about the conversations on that disc.  The "swb1"
subdirectory contains the NIST SPHERE-headered binary files containing
the speech by both speakers in each conversation.  The wavefiles are
named "swXXXX.wav" where XXXX is the conversation number.

All transcription files for the Switchboard corpus are on one CD-ROM
(NIST Speech Disc 9-1.1).  This disc has a "readme.doc" file in the
top-level directory and a "trans" subdirectory.  The "trans"
subdirectory contains a "phase1" subdirectory and a "phase2"
subdirectory.  The "phase1" subdirectory contains 15 subdirectories,
one for each disc in Phase 1 of the Switchboard Corpus.  The "phase2"
subdirectory contains 10 subdirectories, one for each disc in Phase 2
of the Switchboard Corpus.  These subdirectories contain the
transcription files.

The orthographic transcription files are named "swXXXX.txt" where
XXXX is a conversation number.  The time-aligned marked transcripts
are named "swXXXX.mrk" where XXXX is a conversation number.  For each
word in the .txt file, the .mrk file gives an estimated start time and
duration.

In the following sections are examples illustrating the contents of
each file type, and some information on the conventions used in
writing them.




3.  The .wav Files

The information in the header of the file sw4940.wav can be
read with the SPHERE utility h_read:

speaker_id1 1423
speaker_id2 1662
recording_date 920508
recording_time 2204
conversation_id 4940
database_id SWB1
channel_count 2
sample_max1 4015.500000
sample_max2 4015.500000
sample_coding mu-law
channels_interleaved TRUE
sample_count 4798496
sample_rate 8000
sample_n_bytes 1
sample_sig_bits 8

"speaker_id1" is the number of the speaker who initiated the call.  In
the transcripts this speaker will be called "A".  In the database
tables the identification number will be under the attribute
"CALLER_NO".

"speaker_id2" is the number of the speaker who received the call.  In
the transcripts this speaker will be called "B".

"recording_date" is in YYMMDD format, so the date of this conversation
was May 8, 1992.

"recording_time" is in HHMM format; recording of this call began at
10:04 p.m. CDT.

"sample_max1" is the maximum amplitude of the signal on speaker_id1's
channel, expressed as a positive linear value; 4015.5 is full scale.

"sample_max2" is the maximum amplitude of the signal on speaker_id2's
channel, which was also full scale.

"sample_coding" tells how to interpret the binary data in the .wav
file; these are coded as mu-law values, exactly as read from the
digital telephone line.

"channels_interleaved" has the value TRUE indicating that 
alternate bytes are the
values from alternate channels; speaker_id1's data are the odd bytes,
speaker_id2's data are the even bytes (where the first byte is 
byte 1); summing successive pairs gives
the entire conversation.

"sample_count" is the total number of bytes of speech data.  Since
there is one byte per sample, but both sides of the conversation are
represented at each sample time, there are 16000 samples per second,
or 960000 samples per minute.  Thus a good rule of thumb is "one
Megabyte per minute," so 4798496 samples represents nearly five
minutes of speech.

"sample_rate" is 8000 samples per second.

"sample_n_bytes" is 1, the number of bytes per sample in the mu-law 
format.

"sample_sig_bits" is the number of bits per sample value, which is 8.



4.  The .txt Files

The transcripts begin with a header-like section which can be ignored
by skipping down to the line consisting entirely of "====".  Some of
this information matches the .wav header information, and was used to
verify and maintain consistency between the two files when
transcribers worked on the .txt files.  The rest is information
inserted by the original transcriber after completing the transcript,
then reviewed and corrected if necessary by one or more QC
transcribers.

The instructions given to the transcribers for rating the difficulty,
amount of echo or noise, etc. are found below in the section on
"TRANSCRIPTION", but will be described very briefly here.  A scale of
1 to 5 is used, where 1 implies good quality, easy to understand,
etc., and 5 is bad quality, more difficult to deal with, etc.

The header section of conversation 4940 is reproduced here
for illustration:

FILENAME:	4940_1423_1662
TOPIC#:		302
DATE:		920508
TRANSCRIBER:	nk
DIFFICULTY:	2
TOPICALITY:	1
NATURALNESS:	2
ECHO_FROM_B:	1
ECHO_FROM_A:	1
STATIC_ON_A:	2
STATIC_ON_B:	1
BACKGROUND_A:	2
BACKGROUND_B:	2
REMARKS:         None

============================================================

The first four lines are self-explanatory.

"DIFFICULTY" means the overall difficulty of transcribing this
conversation compared to the rest of the SWITCHBOARD conversations
this transcriber has done.  It is a subjective catch-all, designed to
alert the user, where no other standard category of problem is noted,
that there may be a soft-spoken, mumbling, or otherwise
difficult-to-understand caller.  The transcriber thought conversation
4940 was not very difficult, but harder than some.

"TOPICALITY" refers to whether the callers conversed generally about
what was suggested by the recorded prompt.  Conversations were not
rejected if callers strayed from the prompt, or even ignored it
entirely.  However, those who wish to group calls for vocabulary
studies, language modelling, etc., may find this a useful guide.  The
transcriber thought that the speakers in conversation 4940 stayed
right with the topic suggested by the prompt.

"NATURALNESS" is another very subjective rating, intended partly to
study after the fact how well the human factors in SWITCHBOARD
succeeded in eliciting natural conversational speech.  The transcriber
felt this was a natural sounding conversation, but less so than some
others.

"ECHO_FROM_B" estimates how loud the crosstalk from the other channel
(B) was on this channel (A), at the times when A was silent and B was
talking.  A score of "1" means inaudible or almost so; a score of "5"
means the crosstalk was almost as loud as the speech on the A channel
itself.  This conversation apparently had little or no crosstalk in
either direction.

"ECHO_FROM_A" is the same estimate, but for the B channel.  To make
these ratings, of course, transcribers had to listen to each channel
separately as well as the combined signal.

"STATIC_ON_A" was intended to isolate the occurrence of electrical
noises often described as static, some of which were caused by the
collection system, from other types of unwanted acoustic
signals on channel A.  It is not clear how well the transcribers
understood this distinction, so there may be many "false positives"
from acoustic noise in a caller's environment.  But in the cases where
strong digital noise was present, they did seem to note it and lower
the ratings accordingly.  The transcriber heard some static in this
conversation, and noted two places in the transcript where it occurred
with the term [static].

"STATIC_ON_B" is the same for the other channel.  None was noted in
this conversation, hence a rating of 1.

"BACKGROUND_A" refers to the presence of noise, including any unwanted
signal of any kind, coming from the environment of caller A.  In this
example, the noise of people talking, children playing, and dishes
being washed caused a rating of 2 on the A channel.

"BACKGROUND_B" refers to the same on channel B.  In this conversation
there were also voices and children on the B side, and the same
rating was given.

"REMARKS" was a field for transcribers or QCers to insert unlimited
free-form comments on the conversation; they were encouraged to note
any unusual characteristics that might help in studying the speech,
and especially any overall sources of difficulty not well identified
in the ratings.  For example, if one caller was eating all through the
conversation, or had a head cold, this was the place to note it.

The remainder of the .txt file is the verbatim transcript of what was
said, with the speakers indicated by "A:" and "B:", and a number of
conventional symbols and expressions which will be explained in the
TRANSCRIPTION section below.  Here are the first fifty lines of the
file sw4940.txt, the example used above:

A:  Okay [children].

B:  Okay Carol.  So, air quality.

A:  Yeah.  Is it, [noise] {sounds like water running and she is doing dishes} I
know in here, uh, downtown Dallas, it's, you, I mean you drive by and you can
just, you can see it.

B:  Uh-huh.

A:  But, then again [throat_clearing] I originally was from California and, uh,
there is a big difference between Texas and California.  #And, uh# --

B:  #Surely.#

A:  -- they'd have their smog alerts and where you'd have to stay indoors for
so many hours with an air conditioner.  And, of course, they don't have that
here in Texas so, [breathing] there's ...

B:  You mean they don't have the, uh, the smog alerts?

A:  No, not in, not in Te-, well not in Dallas, that is.

B:  Right.  I, I,

A:  [throat_clearing].

B:  yeah, I spent a summer i-, i-, in Tyler so I know, just east of Dallas
there.

A:  Yeah.  We're going there tomorrow.

B:  Oh, really #[laughter].#





5.  The .mrk Files

For ease of use the .mrk files are arranged in fixed records of
four fields, where the first field is the speaker (A or B), the second
is the estimated start time in seconds, the third is the estimated
duration in seconds, and the fourth is the word whose start time and
duration are estimated.  

A "word" in the transcript is sometimes not actually a spoken word,
and in these cases an asterisk is placed in the start time and
duration fields.  This occurs for certain punctuation marks, for
bracketed expressions indicating acoustic events other than speech of
the callers, for transcribers' comments in braces, etc.  

The same convention is used also where there is simultaneous
speech--one talker's words are time marked in that case, and the
other's are left with asterisks in the time fields.

The first 100 lines of file sw4940.mrk are reproduced here
to illustrate some of these conventions.

6.  Ancillary Text Files: Database Tables

In the directory /swb1/tables on the transcription disc (NIST Speech
Disc 9-1.1) are the tables containing information about
the callers, conversations, etc.  To design experiments with
SWITCHBOARD, it is recommended that these tables be incorporated into
a relational database management system (RDBMS) with at least the
relations caller, conversation, and caller_conversation.  The
relations topic and rating may also be helpful.

To insure anonymity, the names of the callers are not included in the
tables, and the telephone numbers have been encoded as follows.  The
area code and first three digits of the phone number have not been
altered.  For each six-digit prefix, a list was made of all phone numbers.
These lists were sorted into ascending order.  For the first phone number
in each list, we replaced the last four digits with "0000".  For the
second phone number in each list, we replaced the last four digits with
"0001".  This was done for all phone numbers in the tables so that it is
still possible to tell when callers were using the same extension, but the
actual phone number will not be revealed.

Here are the suggested relations, and a few rows from the tables to
illustrate their structure:

7.  Ancillary Speech Files: The Collection Prompts

The speech prompts which the callers heard over the phone were recorded by a
female employee of Texas Instruments (Jane McDaniel) under laboratory
conditions and digitized as 16-bit, 16 KHz samples.  They were later filtered,
downsampled to 8 KHz, and converted to 8-bit mu-law form before being
transferred over the local network to the Robotoperator disk for use as
prompts. In order to permit researchers to reconstruct the collection protocol,
a number of the "direction" prompts and all of the topic prompts have been
included.  

In the directory /swb1/prompts on the transcription disc (NIST Speech Disc
9-1.1) are NIST SPHERE-headered files containing the prompts.  Also in this
directory is a shell script named "demo.sh" that will demonstrate what prompts
callers would have heard when setting up a Switchboard call.

Along with each prompt is the "Topic Description," a word or short phrase which
summarizes its content.




8.  How The Data Was Collected

HARDWARE: the Robotoperator

The search for an off-the-shelf hardware platform capable of meeting the
SWITCHBOARD requirements led to the "Robotoperator," a PC-based voicemail and
call management system from InterVoice, Inc. (IVI).  The Robotoperator
typically answers, transfers, forwards or otherwise handles incoming calls
using touchtone detection and stored messages; it can also make outgoing calls,
record speech directly from a T1 line, and consult a database (e.g., of bank
account balances) to make decisions.

See Figure 1 for a diagram of the hardware setup.  Note that the
Robotoperator includes a T1 interface and a software controllable switching
network ("Switchware"), which can interconnect any of the T1 channels with each
other and/or with the PS/2's message file on disk.  This was a key capability
for SWITCHBOARD which was lacking in other telephone interfaces: two callers on
the line with the Robotoperator simultaneously could become one two-way
telephone conversation by connecting the Transmit (T) side of one to the
Receive (R) side of the other.  But at the same time, by recording to disk from
each T side separately (as if the two callers were leaving distinct
"messages"), it was possible to isolate the two sides of this conversation.
The isolation might not be perfect, since signal reflections ("echos") often
occur on the telephone network, but it would be far better than one could
achieve by processing a single channel version after the fact.

SOFTWARE: the IVI application program

The software on the Robotoperator was licensed with the system.  To achieve the
functionality required by customers, IVI provides a user application program,
which is created with a fourth generation programming language interface.
Although customers can learn to use this interface themselves, programming and
debugging of the first user application is provided by IVI as part of the
Robotoperator purchase and licensing agreement.  The functional block diagram
of Figure 2 contains the essentials of the application program.

The basic idea of achieving the SWITCHBOARD scenario with the Robotoperator can
be followed from the diagram.  An incoming phone call is treated like a call to
a business (e.g., a bank) in which a customer interacts with the computer via
touchtones and recorded prompts, requests information (e.g., his account
balance) which must be retrieved from a database, adds information to the
database, and leaves a digitally recorded voice message.  Meanwhile, the system
makes an outgoing call to another customer who, if he wishes, follows the
recorded prompts through a similar transaction, and also leaves a message.  In
this respect the functions of the Robotoperator are not unlike those of its
customary commercial applications.  The unusual requirement of SWITCHBOARD is
that the computer coordinate the two calls, cause them to be connected together
at a certain point, and start and end recording of the two talkers' messages at
the same time.

The application depends heavily on the Robotoperator's database manager, which
is a version of Btrieve for the PS/2.  With SWITCHBOARD, each completed call
changed the conditions for future calls, so dynamic database management was a
necessity.  In practice, a new database was loaded under Btrieve weekly, in the
form of four database tables that were both read and written to, which
controlled events for the seven days, and another which was written by Btrieve
to log completed calls.  The recorded calls and the log file were transferred
daily to the TI Speech Research computer system, where the speech files were
processed and the log file used to update the ORACLE database (see above,
section 6).  The other IVI database files were saved and archived weekly.

The remainder of this section will describe in detail how the collection system
operated; first the internal database tables (the ones on the Robotoperator)
must be explained, then a sample call can be used to illustrate the process.

One table, PINTOPIC, was keyed to callers' Personal Identification Numbers
(PIN), and listed which of the seventy possible topics each registered
participant was willing to talk about.  One field was reserved for a flag
indicating whether he or she had actually completed a call on the topic listed.
Here are sample rows of a PINTOPIC table, with spaces inserted for readability:

4533 301 0  (caller 4533, can talk on topic 301, has not done so yet)
4533 356 0  (caller 4533, can talk on topic 356, has not done so yet)
4533 328 1  (caller 4533, can talk on topic 328, has already done so)
3429 301 1
3429 305 0
6798 301 0
6798 325 0
6798 356 1
 .
 .
 .

A second table, TOPICPIN, contained the same information but was keyed to the
topic.  This table was searched by topic to find a prospective partner to be
called by the system.

301 4533 0  (topic 301, caller 4533 is still a possible partner)
356 4533 0
328 4533 1  (topic 328, caller 4533 has already spoken on this)
301 3429 1
305 3429 0
301 6798 0
325 6798 0
356 6798 1
 .
 .
 .

The third table, CALLER, was keyed to day of the week and PIN, and had fields
for: PIN, day of the week, phone number to call during the person's first
period of availability on that day, phone number for the second period, phone
number for the third period, starting time for the first period, ending time,
starting time for the second period, ending time, starting and ending time for
the third period, and a counter of calls completed on that day.

4533 1 2149950651 2149950651 2149919112 0800 0930 1700 1830 2000 2130 0

4533 2 2149950651 2149950651 2149919112 0800 0930 1700 1830 2000 2130 1
(Tuesday: same schedule, one call completed)
4533 3 2149950651 2149919112 0000000000 0800 0930 2000 2130 0000 0000 1
(Wednesday: 2 time slots, one call completed)
4533 4 2149950651 0000000000 0000000000 0800 0930 0000 0000 0000 0000 0
(Thursday: 1 time slot, no calls)
 . 
 .
 .

The fourth table, TALK, was written by the Robotoperator in the format: PIN_A,
PIN_B, COUNTER_AB, after a completed call.

4533 6798 1
3429 6798 1
 .
 .
 .

Each row thus records a pairing of callers who have spoken to each other, and
how many times.  COUNTER_AB is the number of times these two callers have
spoken to each other, so it would be incremented after the first call.
However, the number of calls permitted was always kept at one.


Another table, CONVER, created a log of successful calls. A new row of the
CONVER table was written at the completion of each conversation.  It contained
the PINs of the callers, the phone number from which the call was made, the day
of the week, a pointer to the B caller's time period (first, second, or third),
the date (yymmdd), the time the incoming call was picked up (hhmmss), the start
and end times of the recorded portion (hh:mm), the topic, and the "message
numbers" for each side of the call (needed to retrieve the recordings.)

3429 6798 2148810028 1 1 920325 090832 9:15 9:20 0340 500 501
4533 2792 8175400128 1 2 920325 091829 9:20 9:24 0359 502 503
 .
 .
 .

In this example, a call was initiated by 3429 at 9:08:32 am; it must have taken
several tries for the Robotoperator to find a partner (6798), since recording
did not start until 9:15.  Both callers heard the prompt about taxes (topic
340).  Caller A's side of the recorded conversation, which lasted five minutes,
could be found by extracting message number 500 from the Robotoperator's
message file, and caller B's side by extracting number 501.


The Robotoperator also produced two other files, HIST (for "history logging")
and LOG (for "special event logging"). These recorded detailed information
about transactions and their times of occurrence: the time of every attempted
call, incoming and outgoing, whether it was a "ring, no answer" or "hangup" or
"busy", which options were selected by a caller as a call progressed, etc.
This information was used mainly for debugging and is not described further
here.



COLLECTION PROTOCOL

The program supported a number of ancillary functions, such as taking messages
and comments from callers, playing recorded instructions on how to participate,
giving error handling messages for busy or no-answer conditions, etc.  These
can be seen as branches in the flowchart in Figure 3, following the
obvious logical paths.

To facilitate understanding of the collection protocol, however, it is probably
best to step through a typical successfully completed SWITCHBOARD call.  "A"
will represent the person calling in, "B" the one called, and "R" the
Robotoperator.  It should be possible to follow this on the flowchart, taking
the correct branch at each decision point.

--Participant A initiates a call by dialing the 800 number.

--R picks up on A's line and plays the recorded greeting: "Welcome to
the Texas Instruments Switchboard.  Please respond to questions by
pressing the appropriate buttons on your touchtone phone.  If you
would like instructions, press 0.  To make some brief comments about
the system, press 1.  To participate in a conversation now, press 2."

--A presses 2.

--R plays recorded prompt: "Please enter your personal identification
number."

--A presses four digits of his PIN, e.g., "4533".

--R checks PIN against CALLER file and verifies PIN.

--R prompts: "Thank you. Please enter the area code you are calling from."

--A presses 3 digits of area code, e.g., "214".

--R prompts: "Thank you. Now enter the 7-digit phone number you are
calling from."

--A presses 7 digits of phone number, e.g., "9950651".

--R searches PINTOPIC for entries with A's PIN, a topic number (e.g.,
301), and a "0" meaning "has not yet spoken on this topic", and takes
the topic number from the first such entry (e.g., 45333010 --> 301).

--R announces topic to A; for example: "Discuss with the other caller
whether there is something seriously wrong with our public school
systems today, and if so, what can be done to correct it."

--R tells A to wait: "Please think about the topic while I locate
another caller."

--R searches TOPICPIN for entries with the chosen topic (301), another
PIN (not 4533), and a 0 (not yet used this topic), and extracts the
PIN (e.g., 30167980 --> 6798).

--R searches the CALLER file for a match to the day of the week, the
chosen PIN, and the current time of day, and checks the flag to be
sure this caller has not completed a call on this day.  If no match is
found on the chosen PIN, TOPICPIN is searched again for another
candidate.

--Once a match is found, the database returns the phone number listed
for the time slot which contains the current time, and R dials this
number.

--B answers the ring and hears the prompt: "Hello, this is Switchboard
calling.  If you are ready to participate, press 1; if the person
participating can be called to the phone without delay, press 2;
otherwise, press 3 to terminate the call."

--B presses 1.

--R prompts: "Please enter your Personal Identification Number."

--B enters 4-digit number.

--R verifies PIN, prompts B: "Discuss with the other caller", etc.,
the same prompt heard by A.

--R connects A to B, and prompts both: "Welcome to both of you and
thanks for participating.  Recording will begin when the person who
called in presses 1. Until then, you may introduce yourselves and get
acquainted."

--A and B converse for a while, without being recorded.  

--A presses 1. 

--R begins timing and recording two messages, one from each line.  The
association of a T1 channel with a message number having been made by
the application software, "recording" is just writing the 8-bit mu-law
values from the T1 interface to the disk without modification.

--If the time limit (a software parameter setting, normally 5 minutes in 
the later conversations and 10 in the earlier ones) is
reached, R stops recording and prompts A and B, while they are still connected:
"We're sorry, but our recording capacity is limited today.  Please try to wind
up your conversation in the next 30 seconds. Good Bye."  Although the recording
ends just before the prompt is played, the callers are never really cut off;
their call only terminates when one of them hangs up.

--When A or B hangs up, R detects end of call, writes log information
to the CONVER table, frees phone lines and resets program variables for
another call.



THE TALKERS

Generally, the talkers were paid volunteers who gave written consent to the
recording and use of their conversations.  Their signatures are on file at TI
along with their personal data and records of payment.  Most were paid $5 cash
per completed call; although TI employees received gifts of comparable cash
value, and some callers refused payment of either kind.  Additional premiums
were paid to some who participated at least 25 times and used two or more
different handsets in a systematic manner.

Subjects were recruited in several ways.  A number were volunteers drawn from,
or recruited by, DARPA contractors and government agencies.  An announcement on
TNET, TI's internal electronic news service, drew responses from about 200
interested TI employees.  Email to a number of institutions involved in speech
research attracted several dozen more.  Finally, a posting on some national
electronic bulletin boards elicited several hundred replies.  Anyone who
responded was sent a registration form and a letter urging applicants to invite
others to participate, which led to more applications.  The letter and
registration forms are included in Attachment 1.

A total of 670 persons registered over the entire course of the project, and
542 participated in at least one of the published conversations of SWITCHBOARD.

It was intended that the talkers be broadly representative of adult speakers of
American English between 20 and 60 years of age.  From the beginning, a bias
toward higher socioeconomic and educational levels was considered inevitable,
due to the requirements of the task.  It was also recognized that a serious
effort would be required to insure representation of all dialects.

The consent form asked where the applicant grew up during the first 10 years of
life.  This community was then located on a wall map of the United States with
the boundaries between the major dialect areas drawn on it.  The names for
these seven areas, plus the term "MIXED," were then used to classify each
person by dialect.

This _a priori_ classification of callers into nominal dialect areas has only
limited value in predicting their actual speech patterns.  Accurate _a
posteriori_ classification of the speech itself, however, would be a very
expensive and time-consuming process.  Since the _a_priori_ procedure had 
been used in
previous speech corpora, most notably TIMIT, it was used again in collecting
SWITCHBOARD for consistency's sake.

Due to the number of TI employees, their relatives and acquaintances, and local
residents who responded to notices, there is a far greater number of "SOUTH
MIDLAND" callers than would be expected, for example, in a random nationwide
sample.

  NUMBER OF CALLERS PER DIALECT AREA


DIALECT AREA	COUNT
--------------------

SOUTH MIDLAND	155
WESTERN		85
NORTH MIDLAND	77
NORTHERN	75
SOUTHERN	56
NYC		33
MIXED		26
NEW ENGLAND	21


Callers were drawn principally from the age groups 20 to 60:

  NUMBER OF CALLERS PER AGE RANGE

 AGE	COUNT
-------------------
20-29	140
30-39	179
40-49	112
50-59	87
60-69	13


The speakers were approximately 55% male and 45% female.  Females volunteered
to participate in greater numbers than males whenever a public announcement was
made, and they tended to participate more actively as well.  The resulting
imbalance was finally redressed (in fact reversed) by posting electronic
bulletin board announcements which asked for male applicants only.

  NUMBER OF CALLERS PER SEX


SEX	COUNT
-------------------

MALE	292
FEMALE	239


The educational level was coded as 0 for less than high school, 1 for
lest than college (but not 0), 2 for college (but not 3), 3 for more
than college, and 9 for unknown.  The distribution was:

EDUCATION    COUNT
--------------------

0            14      less than high school
1            39      less than college
2            309     college
3            176     more than college
9            4       unknown


HANDSETS

Callers, especially those who were permitted to continue past 10 or 15 calls,
were instructed to use more than one handset.  To help keep track of this
variable, for each call and caller a phone number is recorded in the
CALLER_CONVERSATION table.  For the outgoing side of the call, the
Robotoperator simply keeps track of the number dialed; for the incoming side,
the originator of the call is prompted to "enter the number you are calling
from," the DTMFs are decoded, and the number written to the database.

The phone number is unfortunately the only objective indicator of what handset
is being used.  The association of phone numbers with handsets is probably very
high, but surely not perfect, for at least two reasons.

First, people make mistakes keying in numbers; dozens of cases were found and,
where possible, corrected by hand.  Typical errors are transpositions, keying
in a 1 before the area code and number (which causes the last digit not to be
captured), or "bouncing" a key so that a digit is repeated.  Also, there was no
obvious error-recovery procedure if one began to enter the wrong number 
and then
realized the error.

Second, compliance with our requests varied.  Some participants, travelers in
particular, used many phones of different types; some used one home and one
work phone; some complied by using two handsets of different manufacture 
at the same extension.
(In the latter case, when it became known to the project, callers were asked to
key in a number like "9999999999" for one extension, and the correct phone
number for the other.)  In a few cases, we simply cannot determine whether more
than one telephone instrument was used, because the same number was keyed in on
every call.




Here are examples for a few of the  callers' who were asked to vary the handset
they used.

PROMPTS

The prompts were devised with several common sense criteria in mind: covering
many different topics of conversation; choosing subjects that interest large
numbers of people, that tend to generate friendly differences of opinion or
viewpoint, or invite exchanging of 
stories or shared experiences; and avoiding
overlapping or subordinated topics and sensitive or personal issues as much as
possible.

Once approved, the prompts were recorded by an experienced female speaker at 20
kHz, then downsampled and transferred to the Intervoice disk.  Attachment 2 is
a complete list of the texts of the 70 prompts.

In registering for SWITCHBOARD, participants were given a sheet containing all
the Topic Descriptions, on which they could indicate whether they would be very
interested, somewhat interested, not interested, or unwilling to talk about
each one. (See Attachment 1.)  These "topic preferences" were used in
creating the TOPICPIN file described earlier, so that callers were matched on
topics they both expressed interest in.




DATA COLLECTION AND CONVERSION

Returning to the section above entitled COLLECTION PROTOCOL, where a typical
successful collection was described, let us follow the collection process from
the point where the Robotoperator begins writing the speech from the T1 line to
disk.

All recording of speech on the Robotoperator is done in a special file called
VOICE.VOX, which normally stores customer messages.  The software keeps a
pointer to the starting address of each "message" (in SWITCHBOARD, each side of
each conversation) for later compression or extraction.  SWITCHBOARD messages
were kept in their original (uncompressed) 64 kbit mu-law form.  The
application which controlled the recording assigns numbers to these messages so
that information in the database can later be attached to the proper message.

A program running on the PC caused the application to shut down each night at
midnight, rebooted the PC, and ran a series of programs to extract the message
files from VOICE.VOX and to transfer them and the database files via a network
to the Speech Research Group computer system for further processing.  Finally
the application program was restarted for the next day's traffic.

As described above, the CONVER file, written by the Robotoperator, contained
the message numbers, speaker identification numbers, time of day, topic number,
telephone number, and other information.  A C program extracted this data and
combined it with the binary message file to construct a single Unix speech data
file with appropriate header, and also updated the Oracle database for that
call.  The Unix file contained both sides of the conversation, in mu-law format,
with the data from the A and B sides interleaved.  Thus playing back only the
odd bytes (where the first byte is byte 1) resulted in hearing the A side, 
and only the even bytes the B side.
Summing pairs of bytes produced the complete conversation.

The Unix speech file was next played through a Sparcstation to a cassette
recorder to produce an audio tape that could be sent out for transcription.
Three recordings were made of each file: the combined version of the
conversation, the A side only, and the B side only.  This allowed
transcribers to determine what was said during simultaneous speech.



9. How The Data Was Transcribed

Approximately half of the transcriptions were done by court reporters, and half
by transcribers working temporarily at TI.  They were done from the audio tapes
described above, following a transcription manual written just for SWITCHBOARD
and revised several times over the course of the project.  The text of the
transcription manual follows as Attachment 3.

The transcription style chosen had several goals.  One was consistency, another
was utility for research in speech and linguistics.  Human readability, though
not very important for most researchers, was also a consideration because it
facilitates the later steps in the QC process.  When no other principle ruled,
court reporters' practice was followed.

A number of symbols and conventions were borrowed from other projects, such as
the London-Lund corpus and the AT&T transcription manual: use of (()) for
doubtful words, use of "expr ...  \expr" to enclose multi-word events, {} to
enclose comments, -- for interruptions, etc.  

The marking of nonspeech events with [descriptor] was designed to signal the
presence of acoustic events likely to bother a speech recognizer.  The
allowable expressions inside the [] were then limited to a fixed set in
order to facilitate modeling classes of these events instead of a universal
"garbage model."  

The comments in braces give information needed to understand events that
are happening but are not clear from the
text alone, as in {talks to child in room}.  They  should not represent acoustic
events by themselves.  Transcribers were not restricted in their use of these
comments; they would also be a natural place for researchers to record and
share their own comments (perhaps in double braces) as SWITCHBOARD is used for
research.

The treatment of simultaneous speech by bracketing the overlapping texts with
pairs of #s evolved from a more complex scheme, which proved too difficult to
enforce across several transcribers.  Hundreds of files had to be corrected to
the current standard, and the possibility of some inconsistencies cannot be
ruled out.  Transcribers were told to listen to the separate sides of every
conversation as well as the joint version in order to resolve simultaneous
talking.

The RATINGS at the beginning of each conversation are an attempt to translate
the extensive experience of the transcribers into rough indices of quality,
subjective but potentially very useful.  The instructions for using the rating
scale are included in the Transcription Manual.

These ratings have in most cases been reviewed at least once, during the QC
phase; the QCer was considered the final authority, and was instructed to
change any rating which differed from his or her own assessment by more than one.
If, for example, an audio cassette tape was noisy because of a bad recording,
the original transcriber might give a conversation a 4 on DIFFICULTY or
BACKGROUND_NOISE for that reason.  During QC, listening at a Sparcstation, the
QCer would not hear the noise and should correct the rating, say to a 1.

The presence of crosstalk was probably the most difficult of the ratings in
terms of interobserver agreement, but on the whole still a reliable indicator.
For example, an informal study of the first half of the corpus found that
higher ratings (more crosstalk) were much more likely with local and intrastate
calls, where echo cancelling is least likely, than on calls from more than 1000
miles away.

See the Transcription Manual for further details.



10. The SWITCHBOARD Dictionary

A dictionary of SWITCHBOARD was developed at TI as a byproduct of the automatic
time alignment procedure. It was not part of the contract for SWITCHBOARD, and
is not included in the first edition of the SWITCHBOARD corpus because it needs
further work before being made public.  If it is included in later editions, as
is planned, it will be documented fully there.  Nevertheless a brief
description and sample entries are included here, since the dictionary did play
a role in time alignment and QC.

Each entry is a Prolog data statement, containing the spelling, a code for the
part(s) of speech this word can be in English, a phonetic representation of one
or more pronunciations the word may have, and a certification if the entry has
been verified for spelling (v) or certified for accuracy by a linguist or other
professional (c), and by whom.

The surface phonetic level of representation uses a fairly common and widely
accepted symbol set, with three levels of stress and some informal rules of
syllabication.  Phonetic elements are separated by commas, complete alternate
pronunciations are separated by semicolons, but alternate subwords or phonetic
units can be embedded with braces. 

Note that, in order to accomplish the task of time alignment, it was necessary
to enter as words many proper nouns and neologisms which would not belong in a
dictionary otherwise.  Of the 4893 "new words" encountered in SWITCHBOARD
conversations, 49% are names. 

Here are some examples of entries:

lx("Weider","n",{2,w,iy,1,d,er},s).
lx("Noxy","n",{2,n,ao,k,1,s,iy},xs).
lx("nondefense","n",{1,n,ao,n,0,d,ih,2,f,eh,n,s},s).

11. How The Data Was Time Aligned

From the time SWITCHBOARD was first planned, two things were very clear: first,
that the value of the corpus would be greatly enhanced by some form of time
alignment between the speech signal and its transcription, and second, that the
most desirable forms of alignment, e.g., word by word markings created or
verified by human skill, would be far too expensive to justify.  At the
beginning of the project, therefore, two specifications were considered as
possible cost effective alternatives: either mark in the transcript the time of
each conversational turn, or indicate the time at regular intervals of about 5
or 10 seconds.

At the time it was not thought feasible to mark stretches of several minutes of
truly spontaneous conversational speech automatically, e. g., at the word
level.  However, experiments conducted during the early months of SWITCHBOARD
collection indicated that the technique of supervised recognition would
probably succeed in aligning speech and text far more accurately than the
specifications required, and at less cost.  Beginning in July 1991, therefore,
all the conversations were processed by this method, which is described briefly
here.  More details can be found in [1].

Each conversation in SWITCHBOARD has an orthographic transcription and a
time-marked transcription. The time-marked transcription was generated using
an automatic time alignment procedure involving the following steps:

1.)  Create a supervision grammar from the orthographic transcription.  

2.)  Generate a grammar for each word in the transcription, based on an on-line
dictionary and phonological rule set.  

3.)  Execute supervised recognition.  

4.)  Extract the timing information from the recognition output and merge it
with the orthographic transcription.

From the orthographic transcription, we automatically generate a finite-state
grammar uniquely characterizing the observed word sequence. This grammar
dictates a strict linear progression through the text except for simultaneous
speech, as discussed below.

Nonspeech sounds, such as breath noises and laughter, are also indicated in the
transcription but are not explicitly represented in the top level grammar;
however, the grammar does have self-loops at each node, i.e., initially,
finally, and between each pair of words.  Acoustic models trained on the Texas
Instruments Voice Across America (VAA) long-distance telephone corpus [2] are
used for silence, inhalation, exhalation, and lipsmacks, while all other
nonspeech sounds are accommodated through the use of a score threshold which
automatically classifies as nonspeech any input frame not sufficiently close to
any candidate recognition model.

Each word in a conversation generates a finite-state grammar representing one
or more pronunciations, which are obtained from an on-line dictionary. A
separate path through the word-level grammar is generated for each alternate
pronunciation represented in the dictionary. In addition, alternate paths are
added for optional variants derived by applying phonological rules, such as
alveolar stop flapping. 

All the steps in conversation-level and word-level grammar creation are fully
automated.  The sole manual operation in the time-alignment procedure is adding
new words to the dictionary as they occur in conversations.  Initially, each
conversation required the addition of 20-25 words, but this rate decayed
rapidly to about 2 words per conversation, most of them proper nouns.  

Word pronunciations are realized in terms of a set of context-independent
phoneme models. These phoneme models are continuous-density HMMs that have
been trained for speaker-independent recognition of long-distance telephone
speech on 1,000 phonetically balanced sentences (based on TIMIT sentences) in
the VAA corpus. Each phoneme has two variants, one trained on male speakers
and one on female speakers. The sex of each speaker determines which set of
phoneme variants is specified in the supervision grammar.

Each conversation is time-aligned by a hierarchical-grammar speech recognition
algorithm [3], using the corresponding conversation, word, and phoneme models.
The recognizer outputs the beginning time and duration for each word. Since the
recognition models use 20 millisecond frames, all times are in multiples of
0.02 seconds. The recognition output is then combined with the original
transcription to produce a time-marked transcription showing speaker turns.

Two interrelated issues that arose in defining this procedure are use of the
combined-channel signal versus the two single-channel signals, and treatment of
simultaneous speech.  For reasons of cost and time efficiency, the
combined-channel signal was used, since aligning each channel separately would
require twice the processing time.  In addition, alignment of the single-channel
signal is vulnerable to errors associated with the "silent" portions of each
signal, i.e., the times when the other participant was speaking. For example,
some conversations contain considerable cross-channel echo, resulting in a
relatively strong speech signal not reflected in a supervision grammar
representing only one side of the conversation. This unrepresented signal tends
to introduce spurious alignments, resulting in overall alignment failure.

Aligning the entire conversation with the combined-channel signal, however,
requires an effective method of handling simultaneous speech segments.
Stretches of simultaneous speech are labeled as such during transcription, but
it is not generally feasible to specify a precise interleaving of words during
simultaneous speech.  Hence, a simple nonbranching supervision grammar based
directly on the transcription would not yield satisfactory alignment
performance.  The solution was to insert alternate paths in the grammar for the
duration of the simultaneous speech portion.  

Constrained by such a grammar, the recognizer aligns the words for one
participant or the other, but not both; it automatically selects between the
two paths, based on which aligns better.  This method was successful in
enabling the alignment procedure to handle simultaneous speech without going
astray. The disadvantage is that it yields word-level timing data for only one
participant during simultaneous speech segments. However, since simultaneous
speech is typically rather brief, even the unaligned words are localized to a
small stretch of time.

The automatic time-marking procedure seems to be fairly robust.  Out of about
2,500 files, only 12 had to be marked manually for at least some portions of
the file. The primary failure mode in these files is an extremely quiet
speaker; when the energy level is exceptionally low, the alignment process may
fail to find expected words, resulting in overall alignment failure.

The accuracy of the automatic alignment was estimated by marking 10 randomly
selected 30-second excerpts by hand and comparing the results with the
automatically determined times.  Table 1 shows the difference between
hand-marked and automatically marked word alignments, measured separately for
word beginning times, word ending times, and word durations. For all data, the
mean difference in beginning and ending times is approximately one frame (0.02
second).  For 95% of the words, the mean difference is 0.005 second or less,
with a standard deviation of approximately three frames or fewer. Independent
support for this level of accuracy is provided by comparisons performed at
NIST, where keywords occurring in a selected subset of the corpus were marked
by hand and the times compared with the automatically generated times.  About
95% of these words were marked "correctly" in the sense that the centroid of
the word according to the automatic marking fell within the hand assigned
beginning and ending times.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Differences (sec)    |    Begin Times    |  End Times     |  Durations
---------------------|-------------------|----------------|-----------------
ALL       | Mean     |   -0.019	         |  -0.022        |  -0.003
DATA      | Std Dev  |    0.134		 |   0.137        |   0.080
(N=1025)  | Range    |   -1.60 to 0.51	 |  -1.77 to 0.54 |  -0.62 to 0.42
          |          |			 |		  |
----------|----------|-------------------|----------------|-----------------
EXCUDING  | Mean     |   -0.005          |  -0.004        |  -0.001
OUTLIERS  | Std Dev  |    0.048          |   0.050        |   0.064
(N=975)   | Range    |   -0.22 to 0.22   |  -0.22 to 0.21 |  -0.22 to 0.22
          |          |			 |		  |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

As the third row in Table 1 shows, the remaining 5% exhibit wider variation;
in a few cases, alignment errors exceeded 1.5 seconds. Examination of these
cases indicated that the failures were attributable to exceptionally prolonged
words. The acoustic models used for time marking are finite-duration models,
which are generally more robust than infinite-duration models for
telephone-quality speech. However, such models impose a maximum duration on
each word, leading to errors when the input violates the durational
assumptions built into the models.

In summary, although the time alignments provided with SWITCHBOARD are
approximately two orders of magnitude more accurate than the original
specifications, they still leave room for improvement.  As experiments are
performed with SWITCHBOARD, researchers who refine the time alignments provided
should contact NIST so that these improved measurements can be incorporated
into future versions of the corpus.  See Section 14 below for more information.



12. Quality Control Procedures

The transcription quality control procedures began with the daily taping of the
previous day's conversations from the digital files which were downloaded from
the Robotoperator to the Unix network each night.  (The cassette recordings were
needed because most transcriptionists work on analog equipment which allows
them to stop and replay short sections rapidly, change speeds over a useful
range, etc.)  These files were already converted to a format used by the TI
Speech Research Group.

A technician at TI loaded a cassette tape into a deck, then executed a script
on her Sun Sparcstation which played back first the complete conversation
(i.e., the algebraic sum, sample by sample, of the two sides), then the A side
alone, then the B side alone, so that all three versions were recorded on one
side of a cassette with long pauses separating them.  Note that the speech file
had already been named automatically according to the convention:
CONV#_SPKRA_SPKRB.ext, as in 4940_1423_1662, where speaker 1423 called in, spkr
1622 answered, and conversation number 4940 took place.

While the recording took place, the technician listened to the conversation,
checked for problems, verified the information in the filename, and labeled the
cassette for the transcriber.  Problems such as excessive noise or apparent
technical glitches, inappropriate behavior by callers, or misidentification of
speakers were reported to the project manager.

Since the speakers were already registered on the database, the technician
listened for whether the sex of each speaker matched the database.  With this
and other available information, she attempted to verify that the speaker ID
numbers in the filename on the tape label were correct and in the right order:
the speaker whose number occurs first in the filename should be the person who
called in, who would be labeled "A" in the transcript.  Note that this is not
necessarily the person who speaks first in the combined recording, hence the possibility
of confusion if a transcriber does not listen to the A and B sides alone.

The technician then filled out an electronic form with information to help the
transcriber: the topic prompt, the speaker assignments, and the first few words
spoken by "A" and by "B".  This form accompanied the tape when it was sent out.  

When a transcription returned from the contractor, it was processed by an _awk_
program which identified obvious format errors, missing information in the
header or ratings, illegal bracketed expressions, etc.  The program corrected
some of the minor errors, and flagged others to be reworked.

Next the transcript was run through a Unix spell checker (ispell) and a local
version which checked the SWITCHBOARD dictionary.  Words unknown to both
programs were flagged for correction (if misspelled) or entry into the
dictionary.  Any serious problems up to this point were resolved by listening
to the conversation and fixing the transcript accordingly.

The automatic time alignment of the speech file with its transcription took
place next.  If this did not succeed, the reason was sought by listening and
checking the transcript for errors.

After time alignment each conversation was audited from beginning to end while
reading the transcript, checking for misidentification of speakers (e.g.,
switching of A and B during the transcript), and looking for errors of
language, spelling, or format.  A checklist of the most common kinds of errors
(its, it's, they're, their, and the like) was made up for this task.

Finally, a rough check of time alignment was made by playing samples of the
speech file at several places early, mid, and late in the file; the playback
times were taken from the ".marked" file, and the task was to verify that the
words heard were the ones covered by those times in the file.  Errors of up to
a second or so were considered tolerable; usually, errors of that magnitude or
greater revealed more general problems requiring that the file be reprocessed.




13. Technical Problems in Collection

In spite of all precautions and guarantees, a few technical problems did occur
with the collection system.  These fall into two major categories: digital
noise, or "static", and loss of synchrony between the A and B sides of
conversations.

STATIC:  During the first two months of collection, one of the four 
telephone interface cards began to fail intermittently.  When this 
failure occurred , data from the affected channel was replaced by
apparently random values, which are heard as very loud static, for
periods ranging from a few samples up to several seconds at a time.
The same type of noise is occasionally heard on the public network
when a T1 line loses synchrony.  For this reason, and because most
calls were not affected, collection continued for over a month before
the problem was traced to the interface and the hardware was replaced.

Conversations collected before March 23, 1991, which contained more 
than a few seconds of the noise were later dropped from the 
SWITCHBOARD collection.  Those with only short episodes were retained;
the occurrences are marked in the transcripts with the notation
[static], and the noise itself should not be qualitatively different
from what may be encountered on the network, and indeed elsewhere in
the SWITCHBOARD collection.

LOSS OF SYNCHRONY BETWEEN A AND B:  In this category there were four
problems.  Unfortunately, they were subtle and difficult to detect;
fortunately, once detected, they could be corrected to a degree that
should satisfy most users.

All four synchrony problems had one common symptom:  an unusual time
lag between the speech signal on one side of a conversation and its
echo on the other side.  This time lag could be unusual in magnitude,
direction, or variability.  They were thus discovered
serially, in the course of searching for the cause of the time lag anomalies.

i.) The first problem was an asynchronous startup of recording between A and B.
In the original specifications, "simultaneous" startup was called for, but the
need for scientific precision was not understood by the applications
programmers at Intervoice.  As a result the recording of the A side of each
call was being started either 55, 110 or 165 ms after the B side.

The delay was due to the nature of communication between the application
software and the microcode (IDSP) which runs on the interface boards.  This
communication depends on DOS pseudo-multitasking protocols, which allocate time
slices to servicing each phone line.  The number of instructions to be executed
between the time the first (higher, outbound) phone line starts recording and
the time the second line gets its instruction to begin would differ depending
on a number of factors.  

The original applications programmer did not check either the delay (which, had
it been constant, would not have caused a problem) or the consistency of the
delay.  As it turned out, the amount of time required to perform various
housekeeping tasks, after detecting the DTMF signal to start recording, was not
constant.  In some cases the recording of A started in the next time slice (55
msec delay), in other cases in the second time slice (110 msec delay), and on a
few occasions in the third (165 msec delay).  As a result, when the two sides
of the conversation were played together, if there was strong echo on one or
both sides, it could be heard distinctly, especially at the longer delays.
Moreover, in the case of echo on B's side from A's speech, it would appear to
lead the speech rather than lag it.

A solution was finally found which invariably started the recordings within a
few samples of each other.  It involved re-writing some routines in the
application program so that all the housekeeping functions were performed
first, before recording began.  Files containing this error were corrected as
described below under "Corrections."

ii.) The second problem was more serious but quite rare.  It manifested itself
as relatively large changes in synchrony between the A and B sides of a
conversation, caused by losses of 100 ms or more of data on one side at a time.
It is apparently caused by contention for the Robotoperator disk when other
programs were run on the PC while a call was being recorded.  InterVoice
engineers did not realize that this condition could occur, and during the early
weeks of the project they conducted tests while calls were being collected.
Executing DOS commands such as "DIR" while recording was in progress in some
cases caused the application program to stop recording and then resume
recording without any indication of trouble, so that speech data was lost.  The
condition was discovered when InterVoice tried to create worst-case conditions
to investigate the third problem, described below.

Three files were found with this defect, and they were eliminated from the
corpus.  If users identify others, they should notify NIST immediately.

iii.) The third problem was small changes in synchrony between A and B, due to
a pseudorandom dropping of 2 ms chunks of data on either side.  Over the course
of a 10 minute conversation, these could accumulate to a differential of 30 or
40 msec between sides--enough to change a cross-channel echo from inaudible to
audible, for example, or from barely audible to very noticeable, for a human
listener.

When this bug was finally run down, it turned out to be a piece of code in the
utility which extracts conversations ("messages") from the Robotoperator
message master file.  The code performed a check at each data block boundary to
see if the first two bytes had the values "FF FF"; if so, these were
interpreted as header information, and the 16 bytes beginning with "FF FF" were
discarded as not part of the speech data.  This code was a relic from an
earlier version of the Robotoperator which did not deal with mu-law values, and
thus never encountered FF in data.  In mu-law data, FF is one of two ways of
representing zero signal level ("minus zero").  The offending lines of code
were removed and the problem ceased.

There is, of course, only one circumstance in which the chances of seeing "FF
FF" at a data block boundary are good--during long stretches of total silence.
Since the SWITCHBOARD recordings included the silent times when the other
speaker is talking, 2-msec chunks were dropped fairly often but not necessarily
symmetrically, resulting in changes in the synchrony between the two sides of
some conversations.  With respect to the changes caused by this phenomenon, the
recorded conversations fallinto three classes.

a.) Conversations with strong crosstalk on both sides typically show no loss of
data, since there were no long silences.

b.) In conversations with weak or no crosstalk on both sides, any loss of data
is likely to be fairly symmetrical, and could not be detected in any case,
since it is basically a dropout of silence in the midst of silence.  These
calls appear unaffected, and should pose no problem for research purposes.

c.) Conversations with strong crosstalk on one side typically show slippage in
the 10-50 msec range over the entire file, which is detectable because of the
changing lag in the crosstalk.  These are corrected as described below under
"Corrections."

CORRECTIONS.  The files known to be subject to these problems (all files
numbered less than 2453) were processed at NIST to correct the asynchronous
offset and the slippage.  The A and B sides were compared with a cross
correlation measure at various delays.  The lag time which showed the best peak
in the correlation function between speech on one side and its echo on the
other was measured throughout the file.  Early in the file, this lag was a good
estimate of the initial offset (55, 110, 165 msec), which was corrected by
removing that amount of data at the beginning of the B side.  Later in the
file, whenever this lag time changed it was considered evidence of the loss of
data in 2 msec increments from a silent period, and 2 msec of silence was
inserted in an appropriate place on the side that had been shortened.  In files
with not enough crosstalk to determine a lag in the cross-correlation, only a
55 msec offset correction was made.

state fit with your opinions?

waste materials?  Do you think more should be done?  Do you have any ideas on
how to encourage more recycling or on what other materials should be included?
                                                                                
337: SAVINGS AND LOAN BAILOUT -- What do you think were the causes of the
current savings and loan crisis?  Do you believe that the problem is mostly
under control?  Is it being handled correctly?  Could it happen again?
                                                                                
347: METRIC SYSTEM -- Do you think the United States should adopt the metric
system?  Why do you think the last effort to adopt it failed?  What would have
to be done differently to guarantee success?
                                                                                
355: ELECTIONS AND VOTING -- Why do you think that only about half of eligible

363: HEALTH CARE -- Discuss our health care system today, particularly as it
affects you and your family.  Do you think good medical attention is available
to most people?  Do you think the costs are reasonable?
                                                                                
364: HOBBIES AND CRAFTS -- What hobbies do you have in your spare time?  Do they

367: ETHICS IN GOVERNMENT -- Do you think it is possible to have an honest

ATTACHMENT 3:  SWITCHBOARD Transcription Manual, Revision 4: 17 March 1992

Part I:  HEADER FORMAT AND INSTRUCTIONS

1. When the transcription is finished, fill out the template at the top
of the text file as in the following example:


FILENAME:	3021_1279_1108 
TOPIC#:		314
DATE:		910606 
TRANSCRIBER:	RDL 
DIFFICULTY:	1
TOPICALITY:	1

REMARKS: Conversation was dominated by Speaker A.  Near the end of the
conversation there was a silence of about 30 seconds while B went to
answer the doorbell.

============================================================


2.  The first three items are filled in from information provided on
the log sheets for each conversation; the fourth is the transcriber's
initials; the fifth through the thirteenth are "ratings", which are to
be given by the transcriber immediately after finishing a
conversation.  The key to the ratings is given below in #3.

The last item, "REMARKS:", is for brief comments about unusual
characteristics of the conversation, if any.  See #4 below for more
details.

If there are no comments, just type the word "None."  There should be
a blank line after the end of the remarks and two more blank lines
after the "======" line, before the transcription itself begins.



3.  Use the following key in rating each conversation; remember that 1
is good and 5 is bad.  


		SWITCHBOARD CONVERSATION RATING KEY

On a scale of 1 to 5, please rate the conversation according to the
following characteristics:


DIFFICULTY: The conversation was very easy (1)        1   2   3   4   5 
or very difficult (5) to transcribe.

TOPICALITY: The conversation generally stayed on      1   2   3   4   5
one topic (1) or strayed far from it (5).

NATURALNESS: The conversation sounded natural (1)     1   2   3   4   5
or artificial or forced (5).            

ECHO_FROM_B: In listening to A separately, B could 
hardly be heard (1) or was nearly as loud as A (5)    1   2   3   4   5  (Caller A's side)

ECHO_FROM_A: In listening to B separately, A could 
hardly be heard (1) or was nearly as loud as B (5)    1   2   3   4   5  (Caller B's side)

STATIC_ON_A:  There was no static-like noise or       1   2   3   4   5  (Caller A's side)
distortion (1) or a great deal of it (5)     
FROM THE TELEPHONE LINE ITSELF.

STATIC_ON_B:  There was no static-like noise or       1   2   3   4   5  (Caller B's side)
distortion (1) or a great deal of it (5)     
FROM THE TELEPHONE LINE ITSELF.

BACKGROUND_A:  The conversation was mostly clear      1   2   3   4   5  (Caller A's side)
and intelligible (1) or distorted, muffled,   
or otherwise hard to understand (5) BECAUSE 
OF THE SPEAKERS' BEHAVIOR OR THE BACKGROUND
WHERE THEY WERE CALLING FROM.

BACKGROUND_B:  The conversation was mostly clear      1   2   3   4   5  (Caller B's side)
and intelligible (1) or distorted, muffled,   
or otherwise hard to understand (5) BECAUSE 
OF THE SPEAKERS' BEHAVIOR OR THE BACKGROUND
WHERE THEY WERE CALLING FROM.


4.  In rating the conversations, remember that you are listening to an
audio cassette recording of a computerized recording of a live phone
conversation.  Any problem caused by the taping will not be part of
the database, and should NOT be noted in the transcription and the
ratings, but rather in a separate note to TI.  However, it can be
difficult to distinguish between problems that might originate on the
phone lines, on the computer recording, or on the tape recording.
Perhaps the following will help:

The most common problem from tape recording is a type of "dropout"
caused when the computer, while playing back the speech to the
cassette recorder, stops playing and then starts again.  This leaves
up to several seconds of silence on the tape, but no speech is
lost--that is, the recording picks up exactly where it quit, even in
the middle of a syllable.  Ignore this in transcribing; if it gets bad
enough to affect the ability to transcribe, return to TI for
re-recording.

Dropout can also occur on phone lines, usually on long distance calls,
or even in the computer recording process.  In these cases, however,
some speech does get lost during the silences.  If this occurs, use a
descriptive comment like {dropout, part of a word lost} in the text.
If it occurs often, mention this in the REMARKS.

Slowing down or speeding up of speech would be caused by magnetic tape
slipping or sticking, and should not be noted in the transcript.
Return for re-recording if the problem is serious.

In general, DO NOT REFER to tape-related problems in rating the
conversation, or in the REMARKS, or in {comments} in the text (see
below).  If in doubt, say so in the comments and in the REMARKS
section. 

If a tape has several such events that you cannot identify,
or that make it very hard to transcribe, call the TI lab number or
return the tape to TI with a note as soon as possible.


EXAMPLE of a comment in the text: 

{dropout, possibly on phone line?}

EXAMPLE of a REMARK in the header:

REMARKS: Several episodes of very brief dropout on A's side might
have been from the telephone line rather than the tape.  Too short to
be sure.




Part II.  GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS


1.  Transcribe "verbatim", without correcting grammatical errors:
"I seen him," "me and him gone to the movies," etc.

2.  Do not try to imitate pronunciation; use a dictionary form: "no"
will do for "naw," "nah," etc., "oh" for "aw,"; "going to" (not gonna
or goin to); "you all" rather than "y'all"; "kind of" instead of
"kinda"; etc.  Nonstandard words which are not in the dictionary
(e.g., kiddo) should be typed normally, i.e.  without quotes or other
special notation.

3.  Follow the dictionary on hyphenating compounds in clear-cut
cases.  But "when in doubt, leave them out."

4.  Try to avoid word abbreviations: Fort Worth, not Ft. Worth;
percent, not %; dollars, cents, and so forth.

5.  Contractions are allowed, but be conservative.  For example,
contraction of "is" (it's a boy, running's fun) is common and
standard, but there'll (there will) be forms that're (that are) better
left uncontracted.  It is always permitted to spell out forms in full,
even if the pronunciation suggests the contracted form. Thus it is O K
to type he is and they are and we would even if it's he's and they're
and we'd you heard.

6.  Use normal capitalization on proper names of persons, streets,
restaurants, cities, states, etc., but put titles (of books, journals,
movies, songs, plays, TV shows, etc.--what would properly be in
italics.) in ALL CAPS, i.e., uppercase letters.

7.  If it is necessary to use accent marks, insert the number 3 before
the letter which would receive the accent, e.g., fianc3e.

8.  Punctuation: although normal punctuation rules apply, spontaneous
conversational speech is full of difficult situations.  Strive for
simplicity and consistency, with the following specific guidelines:

	-- terminate each sentence with a period unless a question
mark or exclamation point is clearly justified;

	-- use a comma instead of ... or -- or fancier punctuation
when speakers change thoughts or grammatical structures in the middle
of a sentence;

	--for more detail, and for special rules involving
interruptions, etc., see below under SPECIAL CONVENTIONS.

9.  Be sure to run a spell check upon completion of the transcript.
Remember to watch for common spelling confusions like: its and it's,
they're and there and their, by and bye, etc.



PART III.  SPECIAL CONVENTIONS FOR SWITCHBOARD CONVERSATIONS


1.  Speakers should be indicated by "A:  " and "B:  " at the left
margin, with two spaces after the colon, and with a blank line between
speakers (i.e., an extra carriage return before each A: or B: ).  On
the audio tape, A will be THE SPEAKER ON THE FIRST OF THE TWO
SEPARATELY RECORDED SIDES.  IT IS IMPERATIVE TO KEEP THIS DESIGNATION
CORRECT AND CONSISTENT, even when the crosstalk or echo is so strong
that both speakers are equally loud.  The log sheet for each
conversation will show the first few words by each speaker, to help
you confirm the assignment.

EXAMPLE:

   A:  Blah blah blah blah.

   B:  Blah blah blah.

   A:  Etcetera.


2.  Spell out letter and number sequences: D F W, seven forty-seven, U
S A, one oh one, F B I, etc., unless the letter sequence is pronounced
as a word, as in NASA, ROM, DOS.  

Transcribe years like 1983 as "nineteen eighty-three," with hyphens
only between the tens and ones digits.

When a letter sequence is used as part of an inflected word, add the
inflection with a dash: T I -er, B S -ing, the Oakland A -s, a witness
I D -ed him.  This leads to clumsy-looking possessive forms, as in:
the U S -'s policy, the T I -er's last name, all the C E O -s' votes,
but it saves lots of time later on.


3.  Partial words: if a speaker does not finish a word, and you think
you know what the word was, you may spell out as much of the word as
is pronounced, and then use a single dash followed by a comma, -,.  If
you cannot tell what word the speaker is trying to say, leave it out.

EXAMPLE:  

     A: Well, th-, that's what they kept tell-, wanted me to believe.

     B:  I, I, I just am not to-, totally sure, uh, about that.


4.  Hesitation sounds: use "uh" for all hesitations consisting of a
vowel sound (rather than trying to distinguish uh, ah, er, etc.), and
"um" for all hestitations with a nasal sound (rather than uhm, hm, mm,
etc.)

5.  Yes/no sounds: use "uh-huh" (yes) and "huh-uh" (no) for anything
remotely resembling these sounds of assent or denial; you may use
"yeah," "yep," and "nope" if that is what the words sound like.

 
6.  Punctuation: use commas instead of ... or -- or other "fancy"
punctuation when speakers change thoughts or grammatical structures in
the middle of a "sentence."  Terminate each sentence with a period
unless a question mark or exclamation point is clearly justified.
Only use suspension dots ... if a speaker leaves a sentence unfinished
at the end of his/her turn, and a period cannot be used, or at the end
of a conversation where the speaker's turn was cut off by the computer
timing out:

EXAMPLE:

   A:  I was going to do that, but then I ...

   B:  Right, me too.

Use a double dash if a speaker breaks a sentence off and picks it up
at the beginning of the next turn, with another double dash where the
pickup begins:

EXAMPLE:

   A:  I was going to do that, but then I --

   B:  Right, me too.

   A:  -- thought I better not after all.


7.  Non-speech sounds during conversations: indicate these using only
the following list of expressions in brackets.  When making judgments,
pick the closest description; [noise] will be adequate to describe
most sounds that are not represented below. Note underscores (not
spaces or hyphens) to connect the double word descriptions.

[TV]
[baby]
[baby_crying]
[baby_talking]
[barking]
[beep]
[bell]
[bird_squawk]
[breathing]
[buzz]
[buzzer]
[child]
[child_crying]
[child_laughing]
[child_talking]
[child_whining]
[child_yelling]
[children]
[children_talking]
[children_yelling]
[chiming]
[clanging]

[pounding]
[printer]
[rattling]
[ringing]

[tone]
[tones]
[trill]
[tsk]
[typewriter]
[ugh]
[wheezing]
[whispering]
[whistling]
[yawning]
[yelling]

If the event being described lasts longer than a few words, then
indicate the beginning in brackets [ ], and the end in brackets with a
"/", [/ ].


EXAMPLES:

  1.  Separate multiple sounds by a space, each one in brackets:

      A:  Oh, that's funny. [laughter] [cough] Excuse me, I have a cold.

      B:  That's all right, [sneezing] so do I.  [barking] [child_talking]


  2.  Use  "/" to show end of a continuous sound:

      A:  Well, it all depends, uh, on, you know, [baby_crying] how the
      family reacts.  I mean, it can be a positive or a negative thing, 
      you know?

      B:  Yeah, well, I guess so.  It just seems [/baby_crying] to me that 
      it's a very difficult, uh, difficult issue.


8.  When a comment is needed to describe an event, put the comment in curly
braces { }: {very faint}, {sounds like speaker is talking to someone else in
the room}, {speaker imitates a woman's voice here}.

EXAMPLE:

  1.  Curly braces to describe the speech:

      B:  Yeah, yeah, I agree {very faint} right.
 
  2.  Combine curly braces and brackets if more explanation is needed
      to describe the word in the brackets:

      A:  Did it sound like this? [clicking] {sounds made with mouth}

      B:  No, more like [clicking] {sounds like a pencil tapping on a table}
      this.


9.  When a word or phrase is not clear, type DOUBLE PARENTHESES ((  ))
around what you think you hear.  If there is no way to tell what the
speaker said, leave 1 blank space between the double parentheses,
indicating speech has been left out because it was unintelligible.

EXAMPLE: 

    A:  So when I finally did ((take up)) the violin, I
        progressed pretty quickly in the beginning.

    B:  Of course, that was in college which was a long time
        ago, so (( )) I remember.


10.  Marking untopical speech for possible trimming: Use an "at sign",
@, and a double "at sign", @@, to designate potential "trim points" at
the beginning or end of conversations.  These would exclude speech
that either is not part of the conversation itself, or refers directly
to the protocol.  For example, it sometimes happens that callers
accidentally press the touchtone button that begins recording, and are
being recorded during the "warmup period" and don't know it.  All such
speech should be marked for trimming.  Other examples would be speech
that:
	a.) explicitly refers to the SWITCHBOARD protocols;
	b.) refers to the process of making the call;
	c.) uses the TITLE of the prompt (e.g., "music"); or 
	d.) repeats or paraphrases the PROMPT itself.


[The TITLE and the PROMPT for each topic will be found on your
information sheet; they are keyed to the topic number, which is on the
log sheet for each conversation.]

Marking these trim points means that EVERYTHING BEFORE '@' AND/OR
EVERYTHING AFTER '@@' may be discarded without losing the main body of
the conversation on the topic.  These symbols may therefore only be
used ONCE AT THE BEGINNING (@) AND/OR ONCE AT THE END (@@) of the
conversation.  They must also be used ONLY AT TURN-TAKING POINTS,
i.e., at the left hand margin, before an "A:" or "B:", NOT part of the
way through someone's turn.  One or both may be used in a single
conversation, i.e., trimming of material at the beginning is
independent of trimming at the end.

Social niceties and transitional talk are neutral.  That is, they may
be left alone, but should be trimmed if they occur next to material
that definitely deserves trimming.

EXAMPLE:

     A:  Okay, so what am I supposed to do now?  Wait, let me read,

     B:  I think you're supposed to push one.

     A:  let's see, it says here to push, okay, but I think I already,
         okay are you ready?

     B:  Yep.                     [Talking about protocol up to here.]

     A:  Here we go.  Alright, now, tell me, what is your favorite kind
         of music?                [Using topic TITLE explicitly.]

    @B:  I enjoy Mozart and reggae, but I really love rap.  [OK]

     .

     . <body of conversation is here>

     .

     A: I've certainly enjoyed hearing what you have to say. [Trim optional here.]

   @@B:  Well, if we've talked enough, do I need to push a button or
	 anything? I guess not, we can just hang up.  So long. [Talk of 
         protocol should be trimmed.]

     A:  Bye. Nice talking to you.


ANOTHER EXAMPLE:

    A:  Hi, there, how are you doing?

    B:  Fine, how about you?

    A:  Just great, except for all this heat.  [Chitchat up to here could be left
	alone if no reason to trim occurred.]

    B:  Well.  Care of the elderly, huh?  That's our topic?  [Need to trim because it 
	mentions the topic TITLE.]

   @A:  Yes.  Do you have any relatives that need special care?   [This is OK as part 
        of the conversation, since only the word "care" is repeated from the prompt.  
        It is not trimmed--initial trimming ends with the '@'.]
    .

    .

  @@B:  Well, I guess we have solved the problem of care of the
        elderly, and how to choose nursing homes, haven't we?   [Trimmed because it 
	contains both TITLE and a paraphrase of prompt.]

    A:  Sure did.  I hope your grandmother gets better.  So long now, it's
        been fun talking to you.    [Social pleasantries would not be trimmed 
        themselves, but no harm in trimming them in order to get rid of the previous 
        turn.]

11.  Simultaneous talking: Wherever possible, mark where both speakers
talked simultaneously with TWO PAIRS of pound signs (#), ONE BEFORE
AND ONE AFTER each of the segments spoken at the same time.  One of
these segments MUST BEGIN A TURN; in other words, if one person is an
"interruptor", his interruption starts a new turn.

Remember, BOTH speakers' turns must contain TWO pound signs each.

A SIMPLE EXAMPLE:

     A:  Okay, well, I guess that's about it.

     B:  Yeah.

     A:  Nice talking to you.

     B:  # Right, bye. #

     A:  # Bye bye. #


ANOTHER EXAMPLE:

   A: I never heard such nonsense, you know,

   B: # Yeah, I know. #   [B interrupts while A continues.]

   A: # as I heard that # day when I blah blah blah.  [A continues beyond the simultaneously spoken words.]

WHICH COULD ALSO BE WRITTEN:

   A: I never heard such nonsense, you know, # as I heard that #

   B: # Yeah, I know. #   

   A: day when I blah blah blah


ANOTHER EXAMPLE:

   A: I never heard such nonsense, # you know, #  [A starts.]

   B: #Yeah, #             [B starts to step on A.]

   A: as I heard that day when # I was at that meeting. #  [A continues without stopping.]

   B: # I agree with you all the way #         [B comes in over A again.]
