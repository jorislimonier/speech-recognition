# Speech Recognition project

The goals of this project are:
- Evaluating the feasability of deploying the [DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech) STT (Speech-To-Text) model on a device without GPU accelaration.
- Getting a qualitative intuition behind what goes right/wrong in prediction.
- Getting a quantitative intuition behind what goes right/wrong in prediction (*e.g.* with [Word Error Rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_error_rate)).
