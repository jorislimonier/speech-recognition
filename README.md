# Voice Recognition project for Case study

- Focus: Speech to text convertion using DeepSpeech model
- Qualitative & Quantitative analysis
- Evaluate the performance of DeepSpeech on Swithcboard data
    - What goes right?
    - What goes wrong?
- Can we reproduce research-level metrics?
- Evaluate the results using Word Rate Error

## TO DO
Analyse the results and observe what affected to the wrong predictions. Some ideas:
-  The length of the sentences and speech.
- The length of the words (correctly predicted vs wrongly).
- Analyzing structure of the wrongly predicted words. For example: Words that start with W are predicted wrongly in general. We have to make an analyze for this
